# Testing Ignite Apps

At Infinite Red, we want confidence that the code we are shipping isn't breaking the experience for our clients' users.

Our philosophy is roughly based on the following idea from Guillermo Rauch:

> Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.

This isn't a hard and fast rule, but it does express our approach fairly well.

## Detox Testing

We provide a [README.md]([../boilerplate/detox/README.md]) inside of Ignite for how to get started with and run Detox tests once you have Ignited your app.

## Unit Testing

MAVERICKTODO: Add info about unit testing with Jest here.

## Mocking

MAVERICKTODO: Add info about mocking JS & native here.
