# Assets Folder

The `assets` folder is for icons and images used in your app.

### App Icons

For your App Icon, use [Ignite's App Icon Generator](../concept/Generators/#app-icon-generator) which may output resized images to be included in `assets/images`.

### Splash Screen

To update your Splash Screen, use [Ignite's Splash Screen Generator](../concept/Generators/#splash-screen-generator) which may modify `assets/images` with updated images.
